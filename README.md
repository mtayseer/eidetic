# Eidetic

Sometimes I find it hard to remember what I did exactly, so I made this small app to take screenshots of my desktop
every few minutes & save them.

The name Eidetic comes from [Eidetic Memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory)

## Features

[X] Take screenshots periodically
[X] Configurable time slice
[ ] Configurable screenshots path
[ ] Support for multiple monitors
[ ] Don't take screenshots if the user is not active
